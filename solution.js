      "Well, once you look deeply into the history, everyone is tainted. Everyone is evil.Eren has seen and known all this.Yet, after going through so much and learning so much, Eren seems to be doing what he thought the first day the titans breached the wall - kill them all.So, whatever Eren is doing, the final end is the one where the world is saved. And that solution is better than King Fritz’s vow to denounce war and hide inside the walls; it is better than Zeke’s solution of a slow and painless genocide. The solution is to save the world… by destroying the world… Eren is not evil. But he must do what has to be done to save the world. He has no choice.",
